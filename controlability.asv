function [CM] = controlability( A, B )
%controlability: Characterizes a system by its controlability
%   Assuming a system defined by space state equations:
%   dx/dt=Ax+Bu
%   y=Cx+Du
%   The function receives matrixes A and B and returns the controlability
%   matrix of the system and tells if the system is controlable
